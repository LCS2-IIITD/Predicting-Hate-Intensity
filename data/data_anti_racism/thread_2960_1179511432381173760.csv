I suggest instead of spreading propaganda you listen to intelligence briefings or consider a weekly podcast by Mike Morell “intelligence Matters”.  Ignorance is no excuse for spreading propaganda and dare I say it’s treasonous.  ",0.0215341413344229,0.5911611519124838,0.20534833

Guest asserted Meuller found no collusion, as Moscow wouldn’t DIRECTLY assist Trump so as to be covert. @MichaelJMorell if key assumption Trump did it, is wrong, that colors all.
