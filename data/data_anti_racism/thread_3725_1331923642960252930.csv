Daniel F. Baranowski,@DFBHarvard,31516201,1331923642960252930,"Reportedly Gen Flynn has legal bills in excess of $5,000,000.

The vicious Mueller Team costs 100s of Trump Whitehouse staff millions in legal fees they had to personally pay!

All because Democrats & the FBI couldn't accept Trump's Presidency!
