This virus originated in China & became a pandemic because the Communist Party lied about it. Perfectly fine to call Chinese virus. Quote TweetEugene Cho@EugeneCho · Mar 17, 2020Mr. President: This is not acceptable. Calling it the ""Chinese virus"" only instigates blame, racism, and hatred against Asians - here and abroad. We need leadership that speaks clearly against racism; Leadership that brings the nation and world together.
