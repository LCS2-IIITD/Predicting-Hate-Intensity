Benny,@bennyjohnson,31516201,1200922875391356933,"WATCH: Creepy Joe Biden awkwardly bites his wife's finger onstage.

I slowed this video down and zoomed it in. This is some creepy boomer sh*t.

Watch. It's horrifying. Even Jill Biden is noticeably creeped out. 

FYI This is at his campaign's ""relaunch and fix"" Joe's image.
