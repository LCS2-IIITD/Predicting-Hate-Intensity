This is reckless homicide.

#TrumpKnew Quote TweetTed Lieu@tedlieu · Sep 9, 2020Over 190,000 Americans have already died from #COVID19. MUCH OF THIS WAS PREVENTABLE. Many other world leaders successfully suppressed the virus. @realDonaldTrump did not. And he is still mocking mask wearing. This is dereliction of duty by @POTUS on an epic scale.
