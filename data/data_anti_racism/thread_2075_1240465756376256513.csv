President Trump wants the media—and the public—to be debating the etiquette of “Chinese virus” rather than discussing the administration’s slow response, inconsistent statements and lack of prepardness.

In scanning Twitter & Facebook today, seems he’s getting his wish Quote TweetTim Alberta@TimAlberta · Feb 4, 2020Donald Trump is a master of forcing opponents to play the game by his rules.

Tearing up paper? Staging walkouts?

This stuff does not  work. Just ask Rubio, Cruz, Hillary...

The president’s kryptonite is substance and reason. You cannot beat him at stagecraft and emotion.Show this thread ",0.000794594778409647,0.6316944933432693,0.19158863
