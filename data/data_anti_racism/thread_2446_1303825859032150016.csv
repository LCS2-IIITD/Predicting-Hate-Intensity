But it’s even worse. @POTUS took actions that he knew would result in many more deaths. Essentially reckless homicide.

#TrumpKnew Quote TweetNicholas Kristof@NickKristof · Sep 9, 2020Whatever you've read of President Trump's comments about the coronavirus, listen to the tape recordings. It's chilling to hear Trump explain that he knows it's deadly but prefers to downplay it publicly: https://washingtonpost.com/politics/bob-woodward-rage-book-trump/2020/09/09/0368fe3c-efd2-11ea-b4bc-3a2098fc73d4_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-high_woodward-1210p%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans… Listen to the tapes, folks.
