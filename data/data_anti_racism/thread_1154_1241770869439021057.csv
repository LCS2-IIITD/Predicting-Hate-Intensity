Ive been wondering where everyone is getting THEIR fake news from. Our doctors keep telling us there are no tests. Doctors are Dems too now?  ,0.0291886010657226,0.27825884545007984,0.06383634

I guess it depends on who you are and the area you live in.  Generally, if you are rich or famous, you have a much better chance of getting a test, or you are already very sick.

It varies by state and not all governors have stepped up. But saying their are no tests is wrong. And if we weren't testing people the number of cases wouldn't be rising this rapidly.  ,0.4841138728207858,0.6810263292051577,0.05067443
