I don't wear my Veteran hat
Don't fly the flag
Don't talk to my neighbors
Or daughter
Anymore
I quit my job
Locked in
Hiding
From a virus
I don't see Veterans
Once bonded by oath
I wake up at 2am
In tears
Worried
For the America I love
But
Can't feel her anymore  ",0.02886519120515738,0.24072114104410777,0.108527265
