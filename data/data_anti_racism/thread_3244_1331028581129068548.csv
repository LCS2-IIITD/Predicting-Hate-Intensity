Cari Kelemen,@KelemenCari,31516201,1331028581129068548,What I'm asking you to do is remain MENTALLY tough right now. Do NOT adopt their language and do NOT accept their premises. There is NO winner of the 2020 election yet. President Trump is in the process of proving he won and Joe Biden is pretending he did.
