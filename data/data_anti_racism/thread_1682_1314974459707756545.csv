It’s our job to cover this refusal, just as it is to cover Trump’s non-taxes, racism, virus bungling and more. Quote TweetDavid Leonhardt@DLeonhardt · Oct 10, 2020Explicitly refusing to answer a question is rarely smart or sustainable in politics. 

Remember Elizabeth Warren and the question about private health insurance? She eventually answered it, and the delay hurt her.
