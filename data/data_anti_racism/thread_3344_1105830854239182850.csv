Paul Joseph Watson,@PrisonPlanet,31516201,1105830854239182850,"Jay Leno is right.

Mainstream comedy is dreadful now.

How many different ways can you joke about ""ORANGE MAN BAD"" and it still be considered funny?

NPC comedians.

NPC entertainers.

NPC commentators.

All spouting the same anodyne, insipid drivel.
