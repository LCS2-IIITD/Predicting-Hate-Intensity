"Eugene Gu, MD",@eugenegu,31516201,1348431069234663425,Replying to @eugenegu and @JoeBiden There are clear public health benefits to giving all Americans $2000 per month. People can eat healthier with less processed foods that is contributing to obesity and diabetes. Many people won’t feel compelled to choose between working in unsafe conditions or feeding their kids.  ,0.0038878109352043153,0.3457078571144866,0.018365355

Unloveable Me,@MeUnloveable,1610656641,1348431069234663425,All Americans DO NOT need $2000 a month. People who were lucky enough to keep their jobs don't have the need. It would be better to give monthly payments based on need so the money goes further for longer. Remember we still have to pay back the $ that this adds to the deficit.  ,0.655198819229948,0.3773480685865904,0.018370653
