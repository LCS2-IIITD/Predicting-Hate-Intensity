137,Maya Ghattas,@mayaghattas8,1588924358.0,1234899712991518722,Bernie Sanders is not a Democrat. He never has been. I love how his supporters get angry about the « establishment » against him when the only reason he’s running w the Dems is to get votes. He would be nowhere without them. Socialism is not part of the Democratic Party.  ,0.0013646738671247215,0.5717334417289366,0.07036178
