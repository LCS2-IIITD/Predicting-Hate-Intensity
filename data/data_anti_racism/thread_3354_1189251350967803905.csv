Luke.,@Coolhandluke_25,31516201,1189251350967803905,Say a prayer for Amber Rudd tonight. Resigned the tory whip in order to back a #PeoplesVote only for her brother to collapse the organisation from within. Now a GE is upcoming and she has no party affiliation and will be out of parliament in 6 weeks. Brings a tear to the eye  ,0.09182529373932041,0.590058796424453,0.019800317

My prediction is Tory/bxp gains in smaller towns. Lib Dems take affluent remain towns in south and Labour lose big in Midlands and North but gain in big cities  ,2.1682005019205913e-05,0.5852214005468586,0.024217399
