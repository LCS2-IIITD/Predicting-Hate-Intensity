Talking w/ libs who bring up valid points about complex issues is hard work.  I can see why you'd prefer to quit.  ,4.178972134769569e-05,0.44602872270253735,0.018331341

16,EllayGee,@bigsquid67,1590219799.0,1262467278790176769,I agree with you. While I inderstand the desire to protect police/guards. The danger to the community should be weighed more heavily. I suppose my comment should have been directed to @charliekirk11 as he seems to feel  it appropriate to lay some responsibility on the gov of CA.  ,0.010915682606404643,0.35964256435727776,0.017928256
